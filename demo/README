How to run the experiments on your own datasets:

- In the data folder, upload the dataset and the gold CSV files (the latter one can be the effective ground truth or the output of your matching function), and the two PKL files for your blocking function:
    - "candidates" is the list of the tuples representing the id pairs;
    - "blocks" is a list of lists, where these lists are simply the transitively closed blocks (i.e., the connected components in the blocking graph) to be considered in the filtering step - they are obtained from the candidates, so this file is just used to avoid repeating their computation).

- In the "variables.py" file, insert the specific information about your dataset.

- In the "main.py" file, define your query through the parser function (it simply reproduces the dictionary describing the current query as it would be generated through the effective parsing of the SQL query performed in the demo notebook).

This will now rely on the "brewer_ultimate.py" file.
