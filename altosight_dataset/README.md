<h1>Altosight Dataset</h1>

Here you can find the original raw version of the dataset about USB sticks provided by <a href="https://altosight.com">Altosight</a>, whose subset was used in the <a href="https://dbgroup.ing.unimo.it/sigmod21contest">SIGMOD 2021 Programming Contest</a>.

Note that the id represents the unique identifier of the entity the record refers to (i.e., it identifies the cluster of matching records).
The description of the product can appear in multiple languages and the price is expressed in different currencies.
